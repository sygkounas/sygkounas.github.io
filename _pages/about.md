WASP PhD student at Örebro University, Sweden.

I hold a five-year integrated Master’s degree in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** from a university in Greece, where I developed a strong foundation in **Reinforcment Learning** and **robotics**. I completed my thesis through a 3-month Erasmus+ research internship at Luleå University of Technology in Sweden, focusing on **applied AI** and **control**.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at Örebro University, supervised by Professors Amy Loutfi and Andreas Persson. My research focuses on **Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL)**, with an emphasis on integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into **learning** and **control frameworks**. I aim to develop agents that learn through interactive supervision, combining human feedback with language-based signals to improve decision-making in dynamic environments.


I am also part of the WASP-funded project [**Multi-Dimensional Alignment and Integration**](https://wasp-sweden.org/multi-dimensional-alignment-and-integration/), which explores the integration of **language**, **learning**, and **embodiment** in intelligent systems.
